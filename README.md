# No Build Base (nobuild-base)
A "no build tool needed" attempt of a simple-yet-modular base set of starter HTML, CSS, and JS.

[View Demo](https://kccnma.github.io/nobuild-base/)

## Notable Features
* CSS Partials - an old-school approach using native css imports of invidual partial .css files (yes, this DX bonus comes with a known performance hit, albeit a small one for small static sites)
* CSS Variables - a simple, minimalist starter set of global CSS Custom Properties (fulluy customizable and expandable)
* HTML Templating - a native templating system for commonly re-used site sections (eg the site header and footer) using simple, single-file HTML web components (without any fancy features, no shadow DOM, etc.)

## Wish list/Future plans:
* Add a drawer/mobile menu (perhaps via details/summary instead of JS)
* Add a series of reusable components for commonly (re)used design patterns
    * Sliders/Carousels
* Provide different layout/grid options (eg a 12-column grid + a flexible semantic grid)
* Add a local static data web component example for repeatable content
